# Fire-Fighting Mobile Robot

This project involves building a mobile robot equipped with a **4-DOF flame-tracking robotic arm** for precise targeting and extinguishing in dynamic environments. The robot uses **PID control algorithms** to ensure accuracy and integrates **thermal cameras** and **IR sensors** for real-time flame detection with 85% accuracy.

## Features
- **4-DOF Flame-Tracking Robotic Arm:** For precise flame targeting and extinguishing.
- **PID Control Algorithms:** To improve the arm's stability and accuracy.
- **Thermal Cameras and IR Sensors:** Achieved 85% accuracy in flame detection.
- **Autonomous Navigation:** Can navigate around obstacles and locate fire sources.
